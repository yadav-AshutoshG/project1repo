            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
                education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state
                and
                local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and
                Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to
                children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private
                schools in
                India.

                Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood education,
                primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies
                significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste,
                religion, language, and disability.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> The new National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) introduced by the
                Central Government is expected to bring profound changes to education in India. The policy approved
                by
                the Union Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020, outlines the vision of India's new education system.
                The new policy replaces the 1986 National Policy on Education. The policy is a comprehensive
                framework
                for elementary education to higher education as well as vocational training in both rural and urban
                India. The policy aims to transform India's education system by 2021.

                Shortly after the release of the policy, the government clarified that no one will be forced to
                study
                any particular language and that the medium of instruction will not be shifted from English to any
                regional language. The language policy in NEP is a broad guideline and advisory in nature; and it
                is up to the states, institutions, and schools to decide on the implementation. Education in India
                is a Concurrent List subject.
